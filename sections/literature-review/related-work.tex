\begin{itemize}
    \item Traditional \textbf{recommender systems} such as \gls{cbf} and \gls{cf} suggest relvant items based on user preferences and item features \cite{Plexousakis2005, WEI201729, Lu2012}
    \vspace{.1cm}
    %\item These models often lack transparency and fail to support serendipitous or interdisciplinary recommendations \cite{AIinRecSys, Jagadishwari2023, Iana2021}
    \item \textbf{Deep learning-based models} get high accuracy but do not offer explainable results \cite{Zhao2024}
    \vspace{.1cm}
    %\item To overcome these issues, recent works explore combining external knowledge with neural models
    \item \textbf{\glspl{llm}}, especially when enhanced with \textbf{\gls{rag}}, offer explainability and improved contextual understanding \cite{Deldjoo2024}
    \vspace{.1cm}
    \item A promising direction combining \textbf{\glspl{kg}} and \textbf{\glspl{llm}} is explored in \cite{Yang2024, Pan2024}
