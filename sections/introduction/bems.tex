\begin{tframe}{Introduction}
%According to~\cite{Manic2016},~
Builing Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) are essential components of modern buildings, tasked with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item minimizing energy consumption;
        \item maintaining occupants' comfort.
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}
BEMSs control:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC); %HCVA's primary components (air handling units, chillers, heating elements)
    \item lightning systems.
\end{itemize}

A BEMS implements Internet of Things, Digital Twin and Artificial Intelligence.
