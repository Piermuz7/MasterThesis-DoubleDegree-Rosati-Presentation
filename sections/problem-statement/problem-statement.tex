\begin{tframe}{Problem Statement}
Forming a consortium is challenging and requires finding suitable research collaborators.


\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Disciplinary and cognitive differences between researchers make it challenging to find suitable collaborators
    \vspace{.1cm}
    \item Traditional methods rely solely on social networks and, or the number of author citations, which proved to be limited in efficacy.
    %\item Existing collaboration recommender systems are:
    %    \begin{itemize}
    %        \item based on \glspl{dnn}
    %        \item limited in scope, data sources, and user experience
    %        \item not personalized nor explainable
    %    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{My thesis in a nutshell:}

An approach that integrates \glspl{llm} with \glspl{kg} could offer a promising alternative to existing methods.
