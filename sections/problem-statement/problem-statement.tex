\begin{tframe}{Problem Statement}
The problem faced in this thesis is to extract IoT data from sensors and representing it using own ontologies/KGs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The sensory IoT data produced by BEMSs need significant curation before it can be used meaningfully.
    \item Large buildings could have thousands of sensors, which make data transfer and management challenging; %(\cite{Bae2021});
    \item High engineering work requiring multiple domain experts.
\end{itemize}
