\begin{tframe}{Future Directions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Automatic updating of the \gls{kg}} (including information about Horizon Europe projects) to keep up with emerging research topics and thus keep the proposed approach relevant over time
        \item The \textbf{integration of academic \glspl{kg}} could be a useful resource to enrich the \gls{eurio} knowledge base and thus add context regarding the recommendation of papers and researchers.
        \item The construction of \textbf{more detailed evaluation datasets} provided by experts could be future work that could help improve the artifact evaluation
    \end{itemize}
