    \textbf{Main Research Question}:
    \begin{center}
        \textit{How can a \gls{kg} and \gls{llm}-based approach enhance the process of suggesting collaborators for research projects?}
    \end{center}

    \textbf{Research contributions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Investigated the limitations of existing approaches for suggesting collaborators.
            \item Proposed an approach that leverages \glspl{kg} and \glspl{llm} to enhance the research collaboration process.
        \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Application contributions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designed and developed a user-friendly system for recommending research collaborators using real-world data
            \item Demonstrated the system's ability to retrieve and explain relevant collaborator recommendations using semantic enrichment
        \end{itemize}
