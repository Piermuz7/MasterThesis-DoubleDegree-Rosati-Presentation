\begin{tframe}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding sensor IoT data is a common problem and it's impossible to go through it all manually;
    \item A semi-automatic mapping from sensor data to KG could be helpful in BEMS;
    \item GNNs are designed to process and analyze graph-structured data;
    \item Link prediction is predicting missing edges in graphs with high accuracy;
    \item Improving mapping from sensors to KG using GNN by performing link prediction.
