\begin{frame}{Research Question}
    \begin{center}
        \textit{How can a Graph Neural Network (GNN) support IoT data classification in KGs about BEMS?}
    \end{center}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objective 1: Study of KGs and their applications;
        \item Objective 2: Review of approaches found in the literature, then review of KGs and AI methodologies, in
        particular NNs;
        \item Objective 3: Evaluate possible improvements to the approaches found;
        \item Objective 4: Develop a hybrid approach based on KGs and GNNs.
    \end{itemize}
