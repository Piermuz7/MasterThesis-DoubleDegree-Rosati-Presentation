\small{
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\gls{srq}1}: \textit{How can research-related data (e.g., projects, people, affiliations) be modeled into a \gls{kg} for research collaborator recommendation?}
    \item \textbf{\gls{srq}2}: \textit{How can a \gls{kg} and \gls{llm}-based system be designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information from large, heterogeneous data sources to support personalized recommendations?}
    \item \textbf{\gls{srq}3}: \textit{How can the system generate human-readable explanations for its research collaborator recommendations using the \gls{kg} and \gls{llm} outputs?}
